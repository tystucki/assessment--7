    The result for insert do not scale as well as the results for append.
    In the beginning insert runs faster but as the ray increases in size
    it becomes slower.

  Append is slower because it starts at the index of zero, 
  then all the values get .unshift() by one returning the length of the 
  array. The insert method just .push() the last element adding a new element
  from the last index.
